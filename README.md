# Tic Tac Toe

A tic-tac-toe game written in HTML, CSS, native JS, and jQuery. The user is given a choice of a 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 grid; and single-player or two-player mode. In single-player mode, the user plays against an algorithm that randomly chooses empty squares. In two-player mode, play against a friend.
